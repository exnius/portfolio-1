<p class="section_title">Design Process</p>
<p>Our group went through a few design cycles as we developed our idea for a virtual bartering
experience. Initially, we tried to design for all types of users, trying to make it easier for
anyone to barter. From our competitive analysis and initial user research, we determined breakdowns
and areas left uncharted. To address these breadowns and needs, we came up with a list of 
functionality and requirements we wished our site to have.
<br><br>
We then performed brick and mortar observations and spoke to a few expert traders. From this
research, we narrowed down our user base to only collectors as they trade often anyway and normally
go to great lengths to complete their collection.  This additional research produced a new list of
breakdowns that we wanted to mend and provided inspiration for our personas and scenarios.
<br><br>
In the next phase of our design process, we developed wireframes detailing the specific interactions
for our site. We used our personas to guide many of our design decisions and to solve any of
internal arguments about which features were essential to our users.
