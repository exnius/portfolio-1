<p class="subtitle">Design</p>
<p class="section_title">Rationale</p>
<p>This section will be used to justify the design decision made in our website to illustrate
their connection to our user research, competitive analysis, and brainstorming process.</p>
<p class="text_subtitle">Have and Wants</p>
<p>For our competitive analysis, we searched for sites that were targeted at collectors to assist
them in their trading. We found several sites that utilized forums for their users to list what
they had and what they wanted.  The problem with these sites is that they were extremenly difficult
to search.  If you wanted to search for a Spiderman comic, you search could return a thread where a user
listed Spiderman in the items that they currently have.  This type of search result is completely useless
for the searcher. The forums were also extremely difficult to browse in general.
<br><br>
We decided that forums were too difficult to manage and required too much effort on the part of
the user. So we instead chose to implement a way for users to classify or tag their items as something
they either wanted or had to trade. Now a user can specify in their search whether they want to search
for items that other users already have or want, making their search more effective.</p>

<p class="text_subtitle">Pregenerated Items</p>
<p>We knew that creating a page for all of the items a user owned to trade would be a time consuming
and tedious process for the user.  The difficulty would result in poor listings, bad descriptions, 
a lack of pictures, etc. To make it easier for the user to upload their collection and to keep
consistent listings on the site, we decided to create pregenerated items.  Users have the ability
to search for an item, find the pregenerated page, and mark the item as something they want or already
have and want to trade. The user can add a comment to the item if they wish to note something special
about their specific item, but the basic information would already live on the site.</p>

<p class="text_subtitle">Item Price Values</p>
<p>Along with the description in the pregenerated items list, we included the price estimate for
that item.  While this may seem to be going against the bartering system, this information is 
included for novice collectors who may not know the real value of the item they're trading. We spoke
to one user who spoke of several situations in which he knew someone got swindled because they did
not know the value of the trade. To discourage this interaction, we give the novice collectors a price
estimate to quickly judge the fairness of the trade they're about to make.</p>

<p class="text_subtitle">Chain Trading</p>
<p>Most barters are performed between only two people.  The probability that Person A has an item
that Person B wants AND Person A wants an item that Person B has is extremely low. In order to 
maximize the probability a user will find a viable trade, we decided to create chain trading.
Essentially, this technique involves more people in people in the trade to increase the probability
of success. Example of a chain trade: Person A gives itemX to Person B.  Person B gives itemY to Person
C.  Finally, Person C gives itemZ to Person A. A search result that includes a person you can directly 
trade with and trade with in a chain increases the number of possible trades you can make and increase
you chance of success.</p>

<p class="text_subtitle">Suggested Trades</p>
<p>Another difficulty encountered in our research was the ability to find a person with the item 
you want or knowing when the item is available. Your search for an item one day could return nothing
while the next day it could show various users. So we decided to implement Suggested Trades. After
you sign into the site, you are taken to a page with a feed of Suggested Trades.  These notifications
let you know when someone has posted an item in your wishlist AND you have an item they also want. It
would not help the user to include people who did not want anything the user had to offer. Suggested Trades
make it much easier for the user to find what they want and make a successful trade.</p>

<p class="text_subtitle">Edit Trades</p>
<p>An important part of the bartering process is the ability for each person to haggle or bargain. On a
website, it is much more difficult to do this in a timely manner. So after a trade has been proposed, 
any of the people involved in the trade can edit it to indicate a trade they would find more suitable.  This
editing is supposed to replicate some of the bargaining performed in real barters.</p>

<p class="text_subtitle">User Ratings</p>
<p>In our user research, we heard from several people that it was hard to get scammed when trading in
person because you could verify the authenticity of item easily as it is right in front of you.  However,
it is much easier to scam a person during an online transaction as all you have to go on is a description
and photo. To decrease the risk of scamming, we included user ratings. So when a user makes a bad trade, 
the other person involved in the trade can negatively review that person and the community will know
not to trade with that person in the future. This will deter people from scamming each other as it
will hurt their future trades.</p>
