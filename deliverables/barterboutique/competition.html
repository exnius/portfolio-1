<p>We reviewed over five sites that tried to meet the needs of the individuals we interviewed. The table below gives a summary of which sites met each need. From the summary table, we identified the following open opportunities to meet in our site:</p><ul><li>Reputation: does the website allow for users to rate other users on reliability of a trade? This emerged as an important part of trading as trust in the other will determine how likely you will make a trade.</li><li>Ability to track trade status: trading online usually means you do not have the immediate feedback from a real-life trade. Users should be able to keep track of what's being bartered, what the other is asking for, and how close you are to making a trade.</li><li>Targeted to individuals: does the website allow for personalization by giving individuals flexibility?</li><li>Allows for discussion of trade: does the website offer a space for users to discuss a trade? This is important since the conversation in real-life often includes a story behind the items or a discussion of whether or not a trade is fair.</li><li>Allows for Multiswap: does the website allow for a large community to swap with each other in a pool, much like a white elephant game?</li></ul><img src="images/competition.png" width="400" style="height: 293px; width: 502px">
<p class="section_title">Summary of Results</p>

Essentially, most of these competitors lacked the core functionality that we deemed necessary from user research. BarterQuest came the closest to meeting all of these elements, providing all functionality except the ability to track trading status and the idea of multiswap. Although Craigslist is the most popular for providing a space for bartering, it does not facilitate anything else but item posting. It is in essence an online form of classified ads. Discussion of the trade, trade status, and user reputation are not considered. This might be why mass trading of items does not yet exist in the online space. To make sure our idea maintained a unique identity, we took all this into account when considering core functionality. We knew that in order to stand out, we'd need to create the optimal trading transaction space that would allow for discussion and bartering back and forth.
