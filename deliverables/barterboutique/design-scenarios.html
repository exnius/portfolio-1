<p class="section_title">Scenarios</p>
<p>We created two scenarios to illustrate how our novel transaction process can help users such as those in our personas to make trades. In the first scenario, we see Barter Boutique make a suggestion that allows two users to engage in, negotiate, and finalize a trade where both users come away with something they value more highly than what they originally had. In the second scenario, we see a user who is helped by Barter Boutique to initiate a complicated group trade, which would be far too difficult to organize otherwise. Thus, this user is helped in making a trade for an item that he would otherwise be unable to attain.</p>
<p class="text_subtitle">Scenario 1: Negotiating a Trade</p>
<p>Sarah Hofstadter is browsing through the Spider-Man section of Barter Boutique looking at some of the interesting comics there. While she is there, she notices a comic that she owns (Spider-Man issue #252), but had not added to her collection on Barter Boutique. She decides to add it to her collection.</p>
<p>Dominic Ivanov visits the homepage of Barter Boutique to see if he has any new notifications. He sees at the very top a Suggested Trade with Sarah offered automatically by the website. In this trade, he can receive Spider-Man issue #252, which he has had in his Wish List. Barter Boutique has suggested the trade because Dominic has Daredevil issues #52 and #53, which are in Sarah's Wish List.</p>
<p>Dominic decides to offer a trade, asking for Spider-Man #252 and offering Sarah Daredevil #52.</p>
<p>Sarah receives a notification from Barter Boutique that she has been offered a trade, so she views the pending offer. She realizes that she already has a pending trade for Daredevil #52, so she does not want a second copy, but looks at Dominic's collection to see if he has something more.</p>
<p>Because items from Sarah's Wish List automatically show up at the top of Dominic's collection, she immediately sees that he also has Daredevil #53, which she really wants. She decides to change the existing trade offer and make a counter-offer that involves her receiving Daredevil #53 instead of #52.</p>
<p>Later, Dominic sees the revised offer and sees that it is favorable to him. He decides to accept the trade.</p>
<p>Dominic and Sarah have their addresses revealed to one another so they can soon ship the comics to one another. Hopefully, if all goes well, they will be able to give each other a favorable rating on Barter Boutique for their trade.</p>

<p class="text_subtitle">Scenario 2: Chain Trading</p>
<p>Ethan Jebediah Jones is searching for a new Steelers helmet to add to his collection of Steelers paraphernalia. He finds a helmet that is signed by Ben Roethlisberger and immediately knows that he has to have it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he does not have anything that the owner of the helmet, user 'Steeltown,' would want. However, Barter Boutique shows him that if he engages in a &quot;chain trade,&quot; he can get the helmet.</p>
<p>The way this works is that he can give user 'steelerNation' an authentic Terrible Towel, who will give 'heinzward' a pair of Steelers gloves, who will give 'Steeltown' a Steelers football, who will in turn give the coveted helmet to Ethan.</p>
<p>The longer the chain, the less likely a favorable outcome is, but Ethan gives this one a try, and maybe with some haggling, he can come out with the signed helmet.</p>
