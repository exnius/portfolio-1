<p class="subtitle">Research: Directed Storytelling</p>
<p>We used directed storytelling to interview users about their previous bartering and trading experiences. We tried to capture the process of individuals' mental models  and their informational and emotional needs for  bartering. </p>
<p class="section_title">Interviews</p>
<img src="images/flight.jpg" width="400">
<p><strong>Interview 1:</strong> We interviewed a Mechanical Engineering student attending Case Western University while on a flight back to Pittsburgh. We asked the participant if he had any experience bartering. The student had bartered old computers for older PlayStation games and a PlayStation console. 
When asked what initiated the barter, he said that <b>he didn’t need his old computers</b> but that he was interested in new games. He had a friend that needed a computer and that had Playstation games so he initiated the transaction. This participant also stated the quote, <b>“One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.”</b>

<br><br>The participant had <b>only bartered with his friends</b> and was not aware of Craigslist’s bartering option. He’s used Craigslist before but only for cash – i.e., selling apartment furniture for cash.</p>
<strong>Interview 2:</strong>
Our second interview was an informal interview with an administrator who discussed her experience  trading services with clients in the past. She discussed her experience as a therapist that often had clients that were unable to pay for their sessions. 
She said this was common among the other therapists. She would often take paintings or drawings from patients who were unable to afford to pay for sessions. She felt that the hardest part of bartering for services would be to <b>identify a skill that you could trade or barter</b>.
<p class="section_title">Mechanical Turk</p>
<img src="images/mt.gif" width="400">
<p><strong>Description:</strong> We posted three Mechanical Turk hits, or tasks for Turkers to answer the following:
Describe a time in which you bartered something with another person.  
<ul>
<li>Who initiated the transaction?
<li>How did you initiate the transaction (did you post an ad, did you talk?Who did you trade with? Why did you do so?) 
<li>Do you still own the object you received? 
<li>How did you go about completing your barter transaction? 
<li>Did you use any online tools? 
<li>Who did you barter with? 
<li>How did you find that person? 
<li>Do you still own the item you received? 
<li>What did you trade? 
<li>How did you feel after trading your object? 
<li>How did you feel after receiving the object you wanted?
</ul>
We found from our Mechanical Turk results that individuals <b>primarily bartered electronics such as games and laptops/computers</b>. One participant mentioned that he only trades one item type for similar types of items, such as <b>games for games</b> and <b>books for books</b>. Though two out of the three participants only traded with friends,one participant was a frequent customer at <b>local garage sales</b> and usually bartered for larger and more expensive items. He preferred to pay a couple of bucks for smaller items. Two participants barter one or more times per month while the third participant only barters about once per year. Most participants had positive reactions to the bartering experience. For example, one person  &quot;felt over the moon&quot; after his trade.  Only one participant used an online tool; however, it was by accident. He was selling his smart phone to 
purchase a smaller business phone. Another person on the site sent him a personal message asking him if he was interested in trading.  
As a result, he was able to &quot;<b>[cut] out the middle steps</b> which were potentially quite costly&quot; and trade his old Nokia 3560 for a Nokia 6610. </div>
