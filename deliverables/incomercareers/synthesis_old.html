Naturally, we initially focused on the obstacles that international students Beginning with only our assumptions about the obstacles international job seekers encounter, we created our first persona: Sumit.INITIAL PERSONABioSumit is 37 and is a single, Indian man who practices Islam. He recently moved to Minneapolis to take a position at a major US hospital as an internist. Sumit speaks Hindi, and speaks English with a minor accent. He completed an undergraduate and medical degree in India. Travelling DetailsFor his new job he’ll be travelling to conferences and hopes to take a few vacations to cities he’s heard about, but never visited. GoalsThough Sumit wants to practice medicine in the US indefinitely, he wants to stay in touch with his religious roots. To do so, he knows he’ll have to somehow become familiar with the Islamic community in his area, in his field, and also in areas where he’ll be travelling. Sumit’s main goals are to build a professional reputation within the medical community, practice his faith, and surround himself with people of similar standards and beliefs. Scenarios• Upon arriving in a city Sumit would like to locate places of religious interest and a place to attend a Friday mosque service.• He is interested in meeting groups of young Islamic people in the areas he’s visiting• When he’s attending a medical conference, he wants to connect with people from (his home country? of his faith?) for purposes of discussion, going out to dinner, etc.From our team discussions, competitive analysis, and research with both incomers and career experts, we came up with several insightful points that redirected our initial design direction. Speaking to international students at a job fair, we discovered that it is important for them to know how likely a company is in taking international hires. Though there are many great job opportunities at Carnegie Mellon job fairs, international students want to focus on companies that hire recent international graduates and are open to diverse cultures. The spring job fair at Carnegie Mellon University prompted us to think about the problem space that occurs with finding companies that are likely to hire internationals. This specific scenario of being at a job fair presents a more compelling mobile experience than document management.Our main and most important insight stemmed from a consolidation of our research. We found through talking with incomers and career experts that mobile document management is not a pressing need to be filled. Most companies that do hire internationals handle the document process for the hiree. So, instead of designing a more specific form of a task manager, our team decided to refocus our direction to helping job seekers find companies with a high percentage of international employees. We found that the best way to measure a company's "internationality" is through the number of H1B's filed.FINAL PERSONASBioSumit is 24 years old, single, and Indian. He is finishing up a Masters in Software Engineering program at Carnegie Mellon. Sumit speaks Hindi, and speaks English with a strong accent. He completed an undergraduate degree in India, but hopes to find a job in the US, and potentially become a US citizen. GoalsSumit hopes to find the best job possible out of college, wherever that might be. There are lots of good opportunities around, but he wants to focus his efforts on companies that hire recent international grads and are friendly toward people from other cultures. Scenarios• He is at a job fair, and wants to know which booths to visit and what questions to ask. He is particularly interested in whether a company hires non-US citizens, how friendly the company is to non-fluent English speakers, and whether there are other people from his home country that work there.• Wants to see companies in a given city that hire foreigners and what their ratings are.• He is applying for jobs and wants to know what sort of application process to expect for internationals like himself at the different companies he’s applying to.  If different jobs need different sets of documents, he wants to keep each set together with each job, along with the HR contacts and deadlines for that particular application process.• He wants to be a US citizen at some point, so he needs to keep track of all of the documents and filings he needs to make.• He’s is behind on applying for his work visa (he already has his student visa -- kmr) and wants to get a sense for how long it’s taken for various people. </p><div class="credits">Team:<br><ul><li>Name Lastname</li><li>Name Lastname</li><li>Name Lastname</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="right_column"></div><div class="bottom_bar"></div><div class="second_bottom_bar"></div><div class="footer">BID 2011 .
