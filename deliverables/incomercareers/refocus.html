<p class="section_title">Design Refocus</p>
<p>
From our team discussions, competitive analysis, and research with both incomers and career experts, 
we came up with several insightful points that redirected our initial design direction. 
</p>

<strong><em>Knowing company information is helpful</em></strong>
<p>Speaking to international students at a job fair, we discovered that it is important for them to know 
how likely a company is in taking international hires. Though there are many great job opportunities 
at Carnegie Mellon job fairs, international students want to focus on companies that hire recent 
international graduates and are open to diverse cultures. </p>

<strong><em>Job fairs present a more compelling problem space</em></strong>
<p>The spring job fair at Carnegie Mellon University prompted us to think about the problem space that 
occurs with finding companies that are likely to hire internationals. This specific scenario of being 
at a job fair presents a more compelling mobile experience than document management.</p><br />

<strong><em>Internationals do not need mobile document management</em></strong>
<p>Our main and most important insight stemmed from a consolidation of our research. We found through 
talking with incomers and career experts that mobile document management is not a pressing need to 
be filled. Most companies that do hire internationals handle the document process for the hiree. So, 
instead of designing a more specific form of a task manager, our team decided to refocus our direction 
to helping job seekers find companies with a high percentage of international employees. We found that 
the best way to measure a company's "internationality" is through the number of H1B's filed.
