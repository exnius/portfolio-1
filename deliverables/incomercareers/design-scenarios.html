These journies are chronicled in the <a href="design-scenarios.html">scenarios</a> and <a href="design-wireframes.html">wireframes</a> pages respectively.</p><p>We eventually settled our focus on the sort of reconnaissance most relevant during a job fair, helping our target user group quickly identify companies of interest as friendly to internationals.</p><p class="text_subtitle">Sumit Attends A Job Fair</p><ol><li>Sumit looks over the list of companies published by his University, quickly searching them in incomer and building a favorites list.<li>While at the job fair, Sumit looks over his favorites list for companies that hire internationals.<li>Sumit gets in line for one of his top choices &ndash; they have a substantial H1B reputation. <li>While waiting in line, Sumit drills into the company entry and looks at the company details.  He sees that they have locations all over the US, and an office in his home country &ndash; this will make family visits convenient.<li>The line is long, so Sumit explores more of the detailed information available about the company.  He touches "News," which brings up a Google Finance search of the company.  He spends the rest of the line burning through recent events relevant to the company he'd like to apply for.<li>Sumit reaches the front of the line and has a productive and informed conversation with the recruiter. The recruiter asks Sumit to go ahead and send a soft copy of his resume.<li>Sumit can touch "Draft email to recruiter" right from incomer. It brings up an email with some basic boilerplate mentioning Sumit and his preferred position.  Sumit's resume has been extracted from LinkedIn, and is already attached to the email.  Sumit saves the email to drafts, so that he can modify it later with details about his chat with the recruiter.</ol></div></div><div class="right_column"></div><div class="bottom_bar"></div><div class="second_bottom_bar"></div><div class="footer">BID 2011 .
