<p class="subtitle">Synthesis</p>


<p>From the very beginning of the project, our team knew we wanted to address a problem that immigrants 
encounter in the area of employment. Naturally, we initially focused on the challenges that international students have
with documentation.

Beginning with only our assumptions about the obstacles international job seekers encounter, we created our first persona: Sumit.

<p class="section_title">Initial Persona</p>
<img src="images/sumit.png" style="float: left; padding: 3px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid black;"/>
<p class="text_subtitle">Sumit</p>
<em>Bio</em><br />

Sumit is 37 and is a single, Indian man who practices Islam. He recently moved to Minneapolis to take a 
position at a major US hospital as an internist. Sumit speaks Hindi, and speaks English with a minor accent. 
He completed an undergraduate and medical degree in India.<br /><br />
 
<em>Traveling Details</em><br />
For his new job he’ll be traveling to conferences and hopes to take a few vacations to cities he’s heard about, but never visited.<br /><br />
 
<em>Goals</em><br />
Though Sumit wants to practice medicine in the US indefinitely, he wants to stay in touch with his religious roots. To do so, he knows he’ll have to somehow become familiar with the Islamic community in his area, in his field, and also in areas where he’ll be travelling. Sumit’s main goals are to build a professional reputation within the medical community, practice his faith, and surround himself with people of similar standards and beliefs.<br />
