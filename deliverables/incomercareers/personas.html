<p>Use this page to Briefly Summarize your project (in 3-7 sentences).  The goal is to be able to glance at this page and get a very quick understanding of your project, approach, and solution.</p>
<p>Use the branding and image/color areas to communicate elements of your project's design language.  Customize as necessary, but keep the main section links intact (top).</p>
<p>And, include team credits:</p>

<p class="subtitle">Synthesis</p>
<p>With the new insights gathered from our research, we set out to create new personas. We took feedback from the initial presentation
of our persona to create a more believable persona less focused on religious goals.</p>


<p class="section_title">Final Personas</p>

<img src="images/sumit.png" style="float: left; padding: 3px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid black;"/>
<p class="text_subtitle">Sumit</p>
<em>Bio</em><br/>
Sumit is 24 years old, single, and Indian. He is finishing up a Masters in Software Engineering program at Carnegie Mellon. Sumit speaks Hindi, and speaks English with a strong accent. He completed an undergraduate degree in India, but hopes to find a job in the US, and potentially become a US citizen.<br /><br />
 
<em>Goals</em><br />
Sumit hopes to find the best job possible out of college, wherever that might be. There are lots of good opportunities around, but he wants to focus his efforts on companies that hire recent international grads and are friendly toward people from other cultures.<br /><br />

<img src="images/jing.png" style="float: left; padding: 3px; margin: 3px; border: 1px solid black;"/>
<p class="text_subtitle">Jing</p>
<em>Bio</em><br/>
Jing is 32 years old, married, and Chinese. She is a physician who has just recently started practicing
general medicine in hospitals. Her husband is moving to the U.S. for work and she has decided to follow.
She does not yet have U.S. citizenship as she is from China.
<br /><br />
 
<em>Goals</em><br />
Jing wants to use her existing medical credentials to practice medicine at a local
hospital in the U.S. Currently, her work visa does not permit her to easily find a hospital to work at.
She wants an easy and informational experience when searching for hospitals that hire internationals.
Eventually, she wants to live in the U.S. permanently with a long-term
visa and possibly a green card.<br /><br />
