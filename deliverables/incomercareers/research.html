<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, but it was a bit different for me. Back in 1997 and 1998, Medsoft came to India for hiring developers. So, I got my job on my school campus. I had 2 jobs: 1 from Medsoft and 1 from an Indian company. I was not really decided whether I want to go to US or not. In fact, after I graduated, I joined the Indian company and did not consider Medsoft for a few months.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How involved was Medsoft in getting the appropriate paperwork done for you to be able to start working?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Totally involved. They are the ones who did everything.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How long did it take for your final Visa stuff to come through officially?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> 1.5 months initially, but then Medsoft had forgotten to send 1 paper and my visa was rejected. They sent the paper within 3 weeks and the visa was approved.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Was Medsoft's ability/willingness to hire international students part of a draw?<p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Kind of. See the first response.
<p><strong>Q:</strong> In general did you find the process of finding a job in the US a challenge?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I did not really "look" for a job in US. I got in through campus.</p>

<p class="section_title">Chan: Software Developer @ MarketSoft for two years, now back in grad school. Navtive of Korea</p>
<!--<p class="text_subtitle">Amit: Software Developer @ Medsoft Navtive of India</p>-->
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Was it challenging for you to find a job in the US?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I had to find someone to sponsor my H1B visa, and about half of the companies I looked at weren't hiring people that required a visa.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How did you keep track of the companies you were looking at?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I made a list in a spread sheet of the companies that would be willing to hire international students.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you intersted in becoming a US citizen?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes so that is something I have to look at too for my next job search, companies that will sponsor for citizenship as well as visa.</p>

<!--<p class="text_subtitle">Amit: Software Developer @ Medsoft Navtive of India</p>-->
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What types of visas/documentation do you require prospective employees bring to the table when applying for a job?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The employee will need proof of work authorization by the time they actually start (for ex, EAD card).</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What documentation do you help them to get?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Overall, H visa and employment-based green card (although there are other, more minor pieces of documentation along the way)</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How long typically does the hiring process take for international students vs. us natives?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There is typically no difference in the length of the process for an international student versus a native one.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Are there times you have to turn people away due to visa issues related to certain countries etc.?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, we haven't run into such issues.</p>

<p class="section_title">Marcus, US Native Physician</p>
<!--<p class="text_subtitle">Amit: Software Developer @ Medsoft Navtive of India</p>-->
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Tell me about the credentialing process for a foreign physician wanting to work in the US?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To practice medicine in the United States, you need three things at a minimum: 
<br>• Medical License (grants the right to practice medicine, diagnose
illness, and prescribe treatment)
<br>• DEA Registration (grants prescribing privileges for restricted meds,
e.g. narcotics)
<br>• Malpractice Insurance </p>

<p>It's important to note that of those three things, only the DEA
registration is federal. Malpractice and Licensure are state-specific.
So my license to practice medicine (and the insurance which the law
requires me to carry to lawfully practice medicine) are adjudicated by
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>So forget Canada. If I want to practice medicine in West Virginia and
Ohio, I need to get licensed (and get insurance coverage) in both of
those states in addition to Pennsylvania. The name for this process is
"credentialing". Usage: "I can't start at the Morgantown clinic until
I get credentialed in West Virginia, which will take another six
weeks."  Note that credentialling is not just about the magic pieces
of paper. It also usually includes (at a minimum) a criminal
background check, a loss run history (insurance talk for a check to
see if any insurance company has ever had to pay a malpractice claim
on you) and other particulars (e.g. in Pennsylvania, you have to be
fingerprinted and go into a special database if you're working with
children).</p>

<!--<p class="text_subtitle">Amit: Software Developer @ Medsoft Navtive of India</p>-->
<p>The Career Center rarely encounters istudents who have trouble finding employers that hire internationals. Typically, employers prioritize skill set; if you’re talented, we’ll take you and worry about documentation later.</p>
<p>in your TT profile, you indicate citizenship--this is also checked by university records. If you are not a U.S. citizen, job listings that require citizenship are listed, but you are not given the option to apply (Apply button is not there). This can be a helpful filter for international students to save time in the job hunt. </p>
<p>If students need advice on legal documents (e.g. how to remain in U.S. legally), they are referred to the <a href "http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/oie/">OIE (office of international education)</a>.</p>
