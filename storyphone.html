			<strong>Role </strong>UX Research and Design<br />

			<p>Oral storytelling remains a powerful way of preserving important cultural anecdotes and helping us see from different perspectives. Mobile technology now provides an increasingly accessible method of capturing and communicating stories to a global audience.</p>
			<p>For CHI's Student Design Competition 2011, a group of us at CMU teamed up with students at DAIICT to submit Storyphone, an interactive voice response system (IVRS) built to capture oral stories from around the world. Storyphone users can call in to either contribute their stories to the archive or listen to stories submitted by others. Our proposed system is a novel use of mobile technology to help us appreciate differences through oral storytelling.</p>
			<p>Designing the system first required a focus that would address the competition's theme: "Connecting..." to help us appreciate our differences. Although we came up with several ideas, we eventually drew inspiration from <a href="http://storycorps.org/">StoryCorps</a>, an organization that collects stories around America. We wanted to curate stories from around the world. To better understand the motivation behind storytelling, we interviewed internationals in the U.S. as well as people in India (over phone). We devised a flow for how the interactive voice response system would work to make storytelling easier over the phone.</p>
