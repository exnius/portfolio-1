			<p>A project spawned from the <a href="http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/About/index.html">Language Technologies Institute</a>, this tool aims to facilitate the process of conducting literature reviews by providing intelligent summaries relevant to a user's research. We identified the user base as scholars whose work requires finding and reading the most relevant scholarly articles to write literature reviews. Still in its early phase, the tool's barebones functionality could benefit greatly from a much improved user interface. </p>
			<p>As part of a team of MHCI students, I used contextual design techniques to explore the needs of such users, evaluate the existing interface, and prototype for future iterations. To understand user's workflow better, we interviewed PhD students who had experience or were in the process of conducting literature reviews. Upon gathering qualitative data from six users, we interpreted by drawing models that helped us better understand what needs scholars had when doing their work. Once we understood that scholars needed specific information (e.g. author, year, journal name, number of times a paper has been cited) and a special ways of navigation (e.g. using keywords, bookmarking important findings), we created prototypes of multiple fidelities. We moved from paper, to balsamiq mockups, and eventually to a clickable HTML prototype that I had created.</p>
