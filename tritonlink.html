			<p>Large universities with loose-knit departments have difficulty consolidating and delivering information. UCSD deals with this by using web solutions, both to organize information for internal staff as well as delivering information to students and faculty. While their faculty portal site received an overhaul to improve the information architecture and interface, the student portal site had remained largely unchanged. Surveys, interviews, and focus groups had indicated that students needed a better interface and restructured information architecture.</p>
			<p>As an intern at UC San Diego's web office, I had the opportunity to redesign
			the student portal site. After looking at survey responses, analytics, feedback
			from focus groups and conducting a heuristic evaluation, I generated three rounds of wireframes that addressed the data. My wireframes took into account my own experiences, student needs, most accessed content, as well as university desires. Upon
			receiving positive feedback from students, the final iteration was implemented into a newly
			designed student portal website.</p>
			<p>Working on projects like this at the web office served as my first experience outside of coursework (though still at a university).
