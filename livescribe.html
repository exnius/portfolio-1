			<p>The Livescribe Pulse smartpen introduces a new way to write and review notes. It uses a dot-positioning system, an infrared camera, and a built-in microphone to digitally capture handwritten notes and record audio. After users transfer the recorded sessions onto their computer, they can replay their notes and review them while listening to the audio recorded at the time, as if they were reliving the lecture. Since the technology is fairly new, people need natural guidance to help them easily understand how to use it. Intuitive use is integral to successful adoption of novel technology. This is especially important in this case since the boundary becomes blurred between a traditional medium (paper and pen) and new technology (digital note-taking).</p>
			
			<p>A group of us at UCSD had the opportunity to employ rapid contextual design techniques to evaluate and redesign the Pulse pen experience. In the process, we discovered a number of non-intuitive elements in the experience and envisioned new designs to solve these problems. As one of my very first exposures to user centered design, this project served to inspire and lead me towards a path in HCI. I conducted my first few contextual inquiries both with students taking notes with regular pen and paper and with students using the Livescribe smartpen. Being a part of the data intepretation, visioning, and prototyping helped to better ground me in traditional HCI techniques.
