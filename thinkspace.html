			<p>Successfully integrating technology into education has become a more realistic goal for both educators and technology experts. With increasingly novel ways of delivering content to students as well as more advanced artificial intelligence, technology can better address aspects like engagement, intrinsic motivation, and evolving content with constantly changing curricula. Much like graphing calculators for math students, biology students can benefit greatly from technologies that make rote memorization less tedious and consequently liberate students to think more critically. This level of critical thinking, constantly emphasized by educators as a top priority, becomes more plausible with the help of well-designed technology.</p>
			
			<p>In a collaborative effort with SRI International, our interdisciplinary team of four Master students from Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Human Computer Interaction Institute set out to understand the learning dynamics that occur between teachers and students in biology classrooms and how SRI&#39;s artificial intelligence could be best applied. Our four month research phase from January to May uncovered important elements of biology learning that must be taken into consideration when designing new technologies. As well, our contextual design techniques revealed a model of learning we call the Learning Cycle, which encompasses the techniques teachers use in the classroom, student methods of studying, and testing in the classroom.</p>
			
			<p>In our design phase, we narrowed our design focus to a widely used method in teaching: Socratic Questioning. As a teaching technique, it prompts student thinking by continually asking questions and consequently gives teachers feedback on what the student needs help with. Socratic Questioning serves as an extremely powerful method of exploring complex ideas, revealing false assumptions, and analyzing concepts freely. Through further focused research and ideation, this design direction evolved into an idea that prompts critical thinking in a way that allows students to directly engage with the content.</p>
			
			<p>I've contributed heavily to the project, conducting user research, data synthesis, visioning, and sketching interaction specs. As research lead I carried out research protocols, testing, and prototyping.</p>
			<strong>Because of client confidentiality, some content cannot be presented. Though, I'd be glad to speak more about this project in person.</strong><br />
