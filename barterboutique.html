			<p>For a project in Interaction Design, we had the opportunity to design a website in the domain of "boutique retail." Instead of taking this in the traditional direction, our research helped us discover more interesting needs in trading. Our final idea, Barter Boutique, is a website that connects a community of collectors and enables them to trade items within their collection with each other. It provides an innovative solution that increases the number of possible trades they can make with automated suggestions and chain trades. These techniques decrease the amount of effort to find a trade and increases a collector's rate of success. With Barter Boutique, collectors can complete their collections much easier when we give them the tools to trade and collect with the world.</p>
			<p>To create a novel and innovative bartering experience, we had to consider our users' needs. We began by exploring user needs using directed storytelling, performing a competitive evaluation of existing barter websites, and by performing brick and mortar observations. We prototyped a barter site based on the limitations we found from our competitive analysis and the opportunities we identified from our directed storytelling and brick and mortar observation results. We completed our process by contributing a feature set to create the best possible barter experience. My specific contributions to the project include: performing user interviews, data synthesis, and prototyping at all levels.</p>
