				<h1>About Me</h1>
					<div class="col2"><span class="mid-font">4 years ago I discovered the beauty of everyday things in a field called</span><span class="large-font"> Human-Computer Interaction</span><span class="mid-font">. Since then, I've worked in web and interaction design to develop a new perspective on the way we interact with the world. As our world becomes more digital, we have increasingly more opportunities to design products and systems that enhance the human experience. I love to design experiences that people fall in love with and for that to happen, I've learned how important it is to truly understand who and what you are designing for.</span></div>

			<!-- PROCESS -->
			<div id="process" name="process" class="section process">
				<h1>My Process</h1>
				
				<p class="mid-font">When systems get complex and unwieldy, the user experience (UX) can become poor if left unguided. Poor UX can lead to sadness and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN37Fn3Hw8E" target="blank"><strong>frustration</strong></a>. When it comes to designing better experiences, process is everything. For certain strategies like contextual research and design, I work best in teams. When done right, collaboration spawns the most innovative ideas. It's like working with your fellow playmates to build sandcastles. Except now, it's based on better foundation: user research.
				</p>

				<div class="col4"><strong>Research</strong><br />
				Using HCI methods like contextual inquiries, retrospective interviews, and cultural probes, we can explore exactly how people work. Many of these ethnography techniques have been used in human factors to better understand the complexity of tasks like flying planes. We can apply these techniques to understand existing workflows so that we can design technologies to support and extend them.<br /></div>

				<div class="col4"><strong>Interpret</strong><br />
				After gathering the data, we need to make sense of it in the context of the project. We can do this several ways depending on the type of data. Typically, affinity diagrams help the team quickly draw big ideas from a large set of qualitative data. Drawing models can help us understand taskflow, cultural elements, and role organization. Once the big ideas emerge, we can start to design brand new ideas or fix broken ones.<br /></div>

				<div class="col4"><strong>Build</strong><br />
				My favorite part. It's always exciting to see your ideas come to life. Interpretation of the data helps to inform and inspire better ideas. Before fully implementing, it's a good idea to create rough prototypes. This means sketching, wireframing, and paper prototyping before getting into higher levels of fidelity. These help to communicate ideas to each other and to quickly iterate on them. The hard part is knowing when to stop. That's when experience comes to play.<br /></div>

				<div class="col4"><strong>Test</strong><br />
				Evaluating a design may be the most neglected part of the process. It's important too! Evaluation techniques should especially be used during prototyping to make sure they don't carry problems into next iterations. We can apply methods like think-aloud, heuristic evaluations, and well-designed surveys to test a final design. Major problems are noted and fixed before delivery. Ideally, this phase cycles back to Interpret for effective iterative design.<br />

								<strong>Design Problem:</strong> Using SRI International's AI reasoning technology and knowledge base, develop an engaging application for AP Biology students through a user-centered process.
							</p>
							<p>In a collaborative effort with SRI International, our interdisciplinary team of four Master students from Carnegie Mellon University's Human Computer Interaction Institute set out to understand the learning dynamics that occur between teachers and students in biology classrooms and how SRI's artificial intelligence could be best applied.</p>

							<p>Over the span of two weeks, I kept track of the items I threw away. I extrapolated from this data to see how much trash would be left on Earth after my death (morbidly estimated age). Seeing that some types of materials take longer to decompose than others, it turned out to be an interesting visualization and a useful reminder about my footprint.</p>

							</p>
							<p>For CHI's Student Design Competition 2011, a group of us at CMU teamed up with students at DAIICT to submit Storyphone, an interactive voice response system (IVRS) built to capture oral stories from around the world. Storyphone users can call in to either contribute their stories to the archive or listen to stories submitted by others. Our proposed system is a novel use of mobile technology to help us appreciate differences through oral storytelling.</p>

							<p>A group of us at UCSD had the opportunity to employ rapid contextual design techniques to evaluate and redesign the Pulse pen experience. In the process, we discovered a number of non-intuitive elements in the experience and envisioned new designs to solve these problems.

							<p>This tool from the Language Technologies Institute aims to facilitate scholars in conducting literature reviews by providing intelligent summaries relevant to a user's research. As part of a team of MHCI students, I used contextual design techniques to explore the needs of such users, evaluate the existing interface, and prototype for future iterations. To understand user's workflow better, we interviewed PhD students who had experience or were in the process of conducting literature reviews.</p>

							<p>For a project in Interaction Design, we had the opportunity to design a website in the domain of "boutique retail." Instead of taking this in the traditional direction, our research helped us discover more interesting needs in trading. Our final idea, Barter Boutique, is a website that connects a community of collectors and enables them to trade items within their collection with each other.</p>
