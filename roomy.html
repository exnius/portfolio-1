			<p>Upon moving out, children typically leave behind items that parents must sort through to maintain a healthy living space. While some technologies exist to make this decluttering process easier for parents, no single product directly helps parents make efficient decisions on how to sort their children&#39;s items. We were tasked with designing a system to help a family transition from including dependent children to including only independent adult children, specifically to help discard and archive accumulated childhood possessions.</p>
			<p>As part of a semester course in HCI methodology, five of us took on a user-centered
			design process to design for parents transitioning from having dependent children
			to having independent children. Upon interpreting data from contextual inquiries, think-alouds,
			and key-stroke level models, our team revealed specific needs for home archiving. Our solution
			involves a mobile application for parents to easily find out how to sort their children's
			belongings. The application allows parents to send photos of house items to their children
			so that a proper decision can be made about sorting.</p>
